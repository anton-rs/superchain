## `node`

A rollup or consensus node powered by [hilo] and [kona].

It can be run as either a standalone node or as an [Execution Extension][exex]
on top of an L1 [Reth][reth] node in the same process.

Under the hood, the node is powered by the [Kona-derive][kona] library which handles
the [derivation pipeline][derivation] of the L2 payloads from L1 transactions.

### Usage

```
cargo run --bin node
```
